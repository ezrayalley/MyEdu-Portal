## Motivation
💡 Why I Built It
As part of my journey into tech and no-code development, I wanted to solve a real-world problem: academic information overload. Students often juggle between platforms, while lecturers struggle with outdated systems. MyEduPortal is my answer to creating a unified, smart solution that supports both sides.

This project taught me:

How to build scalable apps using no-code tools

Effective data structuring with Airtable

UX/UI principles to serve different user roles

The importance of security, usability, and clean design
